Почему класс AccessDeniedException в нашем случае
лучше наследовать от Exception, а не от RuntimeException?

class AccessDeniedException extends Exception {

}

In the class AccessDeniedException we should subclass Exception and throw instances of it to signal any exceptional scenarios.
Doing so we will be explicitly signaling the clients,
that usage of this class might throw exception and they have to take steps to handle those exceptional scenarios.
Checked exceptions.

The runtime exception classes (RuntimeException and its subclasses) are exempted from compile-time checking,
since the compiler can't establish that run-time exceptions can't occur.
Unchecked exceptions.
