   /* Because it makes no sense.
    Protected class member (method or variable) is just like package-private (default visibility),
     except that it also can be accessed from subclasses.
    Since there's no such concept as 'subpackage' or 'package-inheritance' in Java,
    declaring class protected or package-private would be the same thing.
    We can declare nested and inner classes as protected or private, though.
